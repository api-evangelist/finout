      Finout is a FinOps platform that gives companies end-to-end visibility and
      control over cloud and SaaS spend. It unifies costs from multiple
      providers into a single, normalized view, then enriches and allocates that
      spend to teams, services, environments, and customers—even when native
      tagging is incomplete—so organizations can run accurate
      showback/chargeback and track unit economics like cost per feature or per
      customer. Finout offers budgeting, forecasting, and anomaly detection, and
      integrates with major clouds, Kubernetes, and data platforms to connect
      engineering activity to financial outcomes. The result is shared,
      actionable cost insights for finance, engineering, and product teams to
      reduce waste and make smarter, cost-aware decisions.
